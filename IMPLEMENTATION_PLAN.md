## Phase 2: Content (Week 3-4) - HIGH PRIORITY

**Reorganization Summary:**
- **Original plan:** Create 6 new components/sections (Tasks 2.1-2.6)
- **Revised approach:** Transform 2 existing pages + remove services (4 focused tasks)

  - Task 2.2: Product page transformation (consolidates old 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6)
  - Task 2.3: Remove services navigation (streamlined from old 2.3)
  - Task 2.4: Signup page strategy (new, addresses beta-only tiers)

### Week 3: Core Page Transformations

#### Task 2.1: Overhaul Process Page to Validation Flow

**File:** `/src/app/process/page.tsx` (REPLACE CONTENT)

    - Icon: Decision tree or signpost
    - "We analyze results and recommend next steps"

- Page aligns with beta LTD messaging from pricing page

---

#### Task 2.2: Transform Product Page into Full Value Proposition Hub

**File:** `/src/app/product/page.tsx` (MAJOR UPDATE)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**New Content Structure:**

- [x] **Section 1: Update Hero**
  - Badge: "AI Co-Founding Platform"
  - Headline: "Your Startup Deserves Better Than Freelancers and No-Code"
  - Subhead: "Working software + real user data + pivot guidance. All in 2 weeks."

    - **Validation Data:** User analytics, hypothesis tests, ~$450-525 ad spend included
    - **Pivot Guidance:** Evidence-based recommendations
  - Addresses original Task 2.6 (Update Product Page)

- [x] **Section 3: "Why StartupAI vs. Alternatives" (NEW)**

    - **vs. Dev Shops:** $25-50K, 4-6 months, overkill → **Us:** $1,500, 2 weeks, right-sized for validation
    - **vs. No-Code Tools:** DIY, limits, vendor lock-in, monthly fees → **Us:** Real code, full ownership, FREE Founder Tier (no subscription)
    - **vs. ChatGPT/Claude DIY:** Code snippets, manual assembly → **Us:** End-to-end, deployed product, validation included
    - **vs. Cursor/Bolt (solo):** You orchestrate, monthly subscription → **Us:** We orchestrate for you, FREE Founder Tier for life

---

#### Task 2.3: Remove Services Pages from Navigation

**Files:** Multiple
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Decision:** Remove all services pages from navigation to eliminate consulting positioning that conflicts with platform beta launch.

**Actions:**

- [x] **Update Navigation component** (`/src/components/ui/Navigation.tsx`)
  - Remove "Advisory" link from navigation
  - Final navigation: Product | Process | Pricing | Signup | Login

- [x] **Update Homepage** (`/src/app/page.tsx`)
  - Remove "Services Preview" section (4-card grid showing Discovery/Validation/Scaling/Optimization)
  - This section links to consulting services that conflict with platform positioning

- [x] **Archive Services Pages** (keep files but remove discoverability)
  - `/src/app/services/discovery/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/services/validation/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/services/scaling/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/services/optimization/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/services/advisory/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/services/page.tsx` (hub page)
  - **Approach:** Keep files in codebase for potential post-beta reactivation
  - Add banner/redirect if users access directly: "Services available Q2 2026 after beta"

- [x] **Alternative: Add redirect to /beta or /pricing**
  - If user navigates directly to `/services/*` URLs

- Navigation shows only: Product | Process | Pricing | Signup | Login

---

### Week 4: Navigation & Signup Cleanup

#### Task 2.4: Update Signup Page Strategy (Optional)

**File:** `/src/app/signup/page.tsx` or pricing page integration
**Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM

**Context:** User requested signup page should "grey-out all options except Free Trial and rename Strategy Sprint to Beta."

**Note:** This may already be addressed by Task 1.2 (Beta LTD pricing page updates) which includes disabled states for Platform tiers.

**If separate signup page exists:**

- [x] **Show only active tiers**
  - **Free Trial** (active, clickable)
  - **Beta Lifetime Deal** (renamed from "Strategy Sprint", active, clickable)

- [x] **Grey out/disable Platform tiers**
  - Founder Platform tier (disabled with overlay)
  - Agency Co-Pilot tier (disabled with overlay)

- [x] **Add unlock messaging**
  - "Platform tiers unlock after completing Beta validation cycle"
  - Visual indicator showing progression: Beta → Validation → Platform Access

**If using /pricing page for signup:**
  - Verify Task 1.2 implementation includes correct disabled states
  - Ensure "Strategy Sprint" is renamed to "Beta Lifetime Deal" or similar
  - Confirm greyed-out cards show "Unlocked After Sprint" message

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Only Free Trial and Beta LTD are active/clickable during beta launch
- Platform tiers (Founder/Agency) are visually disabled with clear messaging
- User understands platform access comes after beta validation
- No confusion about which tier to choose during beta
- Signup flow aligns with beta-first strategy

**Note:** This task may be redundant if Task 1.2 already covers signup page strategy via pricing page.

---

## Phase 3: Polish (Week 5-6) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Goal:** AI Founders Team integration, refinements, testing, and final prep before beta launch

**Strategic Shift:** Replace traditional About page with bold AI-first narrative. StartupAI is operated entirely by real autonomous AI agents (CrewAI), demonstrating ultimate proof-of-concept: "We validate startups using AI. We're validated BY AI. We're RUN by AI."

**Tone:** Transparent & experimental journey. We're pioneering AI-first company operations and sharing what we learn.

**Integration Approach:** Create lightweight About/Team page as primary home for AI founders narrative. Chris Walker stays behind the scenes.

**📚 Implementation Resources:**
- **Complete Persona Guide:** See `docs/AI_FOUNDERS_PERSONAS.md` for full persona details (Sage, Forge, Pulse, Compass), design guidelines, voice/tone, content examples, and implementation checklist
- **Quick Reference:** See `docs/PHASE3_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for TL;DR version with task breakdown, key files, sample content, and approval checklist

  - **Forge → Build/Deploy Agent**
    - Real capabilities: MVP code generation, deployment automation, technical architecture
    - Input: Strategic framework, feature requirements
    - Output: Deployed MVP, live URL, codebase

  - **Pulse → Marketing/Testing Agent**
    - Real capabilities: Ad campaign setup, user acquisition, analytics tracking
    - Input: MVP URL, target audience, budget
    - Output: Campaign performance data, user behavior metrics

    - Common patterns identified
    - Learning improvements over time
  - Ensure data is anonymized (no customer-specific info)

- [ ] **Link to Agent Code (Optional)**
  - If open-sourcing agent orchestration:
    - Create public GitHub repo with agent code
    - Add link from About page: "See the code behind our AI founders"

## 🚨 Critical Path to Launch (22-25 hours)

### **PHASE 1: Fix Authentication (4 hours) - ✅ COMPLETED**

**Problem:** 
- ~~GitHub OAuth completely broken in production~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- ~~Founder test account lands in consultant dashboard (role routing broken)~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- ~~Users see confusing double-login prompts after cross-site handoff~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- ~~Test credentials not mapping to correct roles~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**COMPLETED WORK:**

1. **✅ Fixed User Creation Method**
   - **Issue:** Users were manually inserted into auth.users table causing "invalid credentials"
   - **Solution:** Used proper Supabase Auth Admin API: `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()`
   - **Result:** Authentication now works correctly with proper email confirmation

2. **✅ Created Working Test Users**
   ```bash
   # WORKING TEST CREDENTIALS:
   # Founder: founder@startupai.site / password123 → /founder-dashboard
   # Consultant: consultant@startupai.site / password123 → /dashboard
   ```
   - Created users with proper roles and metadata
   - Email confirmation enabled
   - User profiles created with correct subscription tiers

3. **✅ Fixed Role-Based Routing**
   - Founder users now correctly route to `/founder-dashboard`
   - Consultant users correctly route to `/dashboard`
   - Role detection working properly from user_profiles table

4. **✅ Resolved UI Issues**
   - Fixed truncated text in demo mode banner
   - Removed blue vertical strip from sidebar styling
   - Improved responsive layout and spacing

**Success Criteria for Phase 1:**
- [x] ~~GitHub OAuth works on production~~ (Email auth working, OAuth pending verification)
- [x] Founder role routes to `/founder-dashboard`
- [x] Consultant role routes to `/dashboard`
- [x] Single seamless login (no double prompts)

**DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**

## 💡 Important Notes

### Don't Make These Mistakes:
1. ❌ Don't skip authentication fixes - nothing else matters if users can't log in
2. ❌ Don't half-implement AI - needs to work end-to-end or it's worse than nothing
3. ❌ Don't forget visibility - if users can't see AI working, they'll think it's broken
4. ❌ Don't skip testing - test each phase before moving to next

### Do These Things:
1. ✅ Test on deployed sites, not just local
2. ✅ Use actual test credentials (not your own)
3. ✅ Verify database writes (check Supabase directly)
4. ✅ Check Netlify function logs for errors
5. ✅ Document any issues you find

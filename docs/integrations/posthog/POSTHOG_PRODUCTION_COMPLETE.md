# ✅ PostHog Production Deployment Complete

**Date:** October 5, 2025, 10:05 UTC-3  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes total  
**Status:** Environment variables configured, deployments triggered

---

## Summary

PostHog analytics has been successfully configured for production deployment on both StartupAI sites using the Netlify CLI.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Netlify CLI Authentication Setup

**Updated secrets file:**
```bash
# File: ~/.secrets/startupai (line 88)
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="nfp_EoBkKMRiN9N1UmoU5iQzU13DdU8RXWhE0e18"
```

**Verified authentication:**
- User: Chris Walker (chris00walker@gmail.com)
- Team: CWConsulting
- Both sites linked and accessible

### 2. ✅ Environment Variables Configured

**Marketing Site (startupai-site):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_u4wa3BdaAvJZEoifVxYuTTXtRa79MOWL42n2NOW9C5Y
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```
✅ Set via: `netlify env:set`  
✅ Scope: All contexts (dev, branch, production)  
✅ Verified: `netlify env:list` confirms both variables present

**Product Site (app-startupai-site):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_u4wa3BdaAvJZEoifVxYuTTXtRa79MOWL42n2NOW9C5Y
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```
✅ Set via: `netlify env:set`  
✅ Scope: All contexts  
✅ Verified: `netlify env:list` confirms both variables present

### 3. ✅ Production Deployments Triggered

**Commands executed:**
```bash
# Marketing site
cd /home/chris/startupai.site
netlify deploy --build --prod

# Product site  
cd /home/chris/app.startupai.site
netlify deploy --build --prod --filter=frontend
```

Both deployments started successfully in the background.

## Verification Checklist

### Immediate Verification (Now)

**1. Check Environment Variables in Netlify Dashboard:**

Marketing site:
```bash
open https://app.netlify.com/sites/startupai-site/settings/env
```
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is present
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` is present

Product site:
```bash
open https://app.netlify.com/sites/app-startupai-site/settings/env
```
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is present
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` is present

**2. Check Deployment Status:**

Marketing site:
```bash
open https://app.netlify.com/sites/startupai-site/deploys
```
- [ ] Latest deploy shows "Published" (green checkmark)
- [ ] Build logs show no errors
- [ ] Deploy time: ~2-5 minutes

Product site:
```bash
open https://app.netlify.com/sites/app-startupai-site/deploys
```
- [ ] Latest deploy shows "Published" (green checkmark)
- [ ] Build logs show no errors
- [ ] Deploy time: ~2-5 minutes

### Post-Deployment Verification (After ~5 minutes)

**3. Test PostHog Initialization on Marketing Site:**

```bash
# Visit the site
open https://startupai-site.netlify.app
```

Then in browser DevTools (F12) → Console:
```javascript
// Check PostHog is loaded
window.posthog
// Should show: PostHogLib {_events: Array(0), compression: {}, persistence: ...}

// Check config
window.posthog.config
// Should show api_host: "https://us.i.posthog.com"

// Manually trigger test event
window.posthog.capture('test_event', {source: 'manual_verification'})
// Should log: "PostHog captured: test_event"
```

**4. Test PostHog Initialization on Product Site:**

```bash
# Visit the site
open https://app-startupai-site.netlify.app
```

Repeat same browser console tests as above.

**5. Verify Events in PostHog Dashboard:**

```bash
open https://us.i.posthog.com
```

- [ ] Go to "Live events" or "Events" tab
- [ ] Filter by last 5 minutes
- [ ] Should see `$pageview` events from both domains:
  - `startupai-site.netlify.app`
  - `app-startupai-site.netlify.app`
- [ ] Check event properties include correct timestamps
- [ ] Verify no error events

## Troubleshooting

### If PostHog Not Loading:

**Check 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
cd /home/chris/startupai.site
netlify env:list
# Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST are present
```

**Check 2: Build Logs**
```bash
# In Netlify dashboard, check build logs for:
- "NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY" should appear in environment variables section
- No build errors related to PostHog
- instrumentation-client.ts should be included in build
```

**Check 3: Browser Console Errors**
```javascript
// Check for errors in DevTools Console
// Common issues:
- "posthog is not defined" → Environment variables not set correctly
- "Failed to load resource" → PostHog host URL incorrect
- CORS errors → PostHog configuration issue
```

**Check 4: Network Tab**
```
// In DevTools Network tab, filter by "posthog"
// Should see requests to:
- https://us.i.posthog.com/decide/
- https://us.i.posthog.com/e/
// Status should be 200 (success)
```

### If Deployments Are Stuck:

```bash
# Check deployment status via CLI
cd /home/chris/startupai.site
netlify status

# Or check in dashboard
open https://app.netlify.com/sites/startupai-site/deploys

# If stuck > 10 minutes, cancel and retry:
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Custom Event Tracking

Use the type-safe analytics helpers created earlier:

**Marketing Site Example:**
```typescript
import { analytics } from '@/lib/analytics'

// In signup component
analytics.signup.started('hero-button')

// In pricing page
analytics.pricing.viewed('navbar')

// In contact form
analytics.contact.submitted('general-inquiry')
```

**Product Site Example:**
```typescript
import { analytics } from '@/lib/analytics'

// In project creation
analytics.project.created(projectId, projectName)

// In AI workflow
analytics.ai.analysisRequested('market-analysis', projectId)

// In canvas
analytics.canvas.bmcUpdated('value-proposition')
```

### 2. Set Up PostHog Dashboards

In PostHog dashboard (https://us.i.posthog.com):

**Marketing Dashboard:**
- Conversion funnel: Visit → Pricing → Signup → Payment
- Top landing pages
- Signup source attribution
- Time to signup metric

**Product Dashboard:**
- Feature usage (projects, evidence, reports, canvas)
- User retention cohorts
- AI workflow completion rates
- Session duration and engagement

### 3. Configure Session Recordings

Enable in PostHog settings:
- Capture 10% of sessions initially
- Filter by error events
- Privacy: Mask sensitive inputs
- Review recordings for UX improvements

### 4. Set Up Alerts

Create alerts for:
- Drop in signup conversion rate
- Spike in error events
- Low feature adoption
- Session length decrease

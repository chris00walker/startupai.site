# Public Roadmap Snapshot

This summary captures initiatives we’re comfortable sharing externally. Detailed sprint plans remain internal and may change.

## Active (Q4 2025)

- **Tell the onboarding story** – Refresh demos and pricing copy so they mirror the live guided onboarding flow.
- **Proof & trust signals** – Publish anonymised Fit Report excerpts, highlight uptime/status badges, and refresh the privacy pledge.
- **Accessibility polish** – Ship skip links and contrast improvements while documenting progress in [`dev/a11y-i18n.md`](../dev/a11y-i18n.md).

## Near Term (Q1 2026)

- **Conversion experiments** – Test pricing narratives and CTA framing with PostHog funnels.
- **Localized messaging** – Pilot EU-focused copy variants once localization groundwork lands.
- **Automated quality checks** – Add Lighthouse/link monitoring to keep performance and SEO healthy.

## Later (Exploratory)

- **Interactive demo** – Let visitors step through a shortened onboarding flow using real CrewAI outputs.
- **Resource hub** – Package evidence-led strategy templates and checklists for ongoing nurture.
- **Lead automation** – Route waitlist/contact data directly into the CRM with transparent opt-in tracking.

# Accessibility & Internationalization

This document reconciles the legacy accessibility plan with the current codebase. It highlights what is implemented today, what remains in progress, and how we extend the system to additional locales without duplicating sensitive detail from the product repository.

## Accessibility Baseline (Live)

| Requirement | Implementation Detail | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Token-driven contrast** | Global tokens defined in `src/app/globals.css` enforce WCAG-compliant HSL values for light/dark modes. Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js`) maps utilities to these tokens. | ✅ |
| **Keyboard-friendly navigation** | Primary nav (`src/components/ui/Navigation.tsx`) uses semantic `<nav>` landmarks, focus-visible styles, and SR-only labels for the mobile menu. Drawer closes on selection to avoid trap. | ✅ |
| **Accessible forms** | Netlify/Resend waitlist (`src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`) validates input server-side. Form components use `aria-invalid` + `aria-describedby` (`src/components/ui/data-entry/form.tsx`). | ✅ |
| **Motion & animation** | Marketing-only animations limited to opacity/translate transitions with cubic easing (<200ms) to respect vestibular comfort. No parallax or infinite scrolling. | ✅ |
| **Semantic content** | Page templates (`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/product/page.tsx`) follow `main > section > h2` hierarchy with descriptive headings that mirror research insights. | ✅ |
| **PostHog consent** | Analytics initialization (`instrumentation-client.ts`) respects `allowSessionRecording` flag before activating session replay, ensuring opt-in compliance. | ✅ |

## Known Gaps & Remediations

| Gap | Impact | Action Owner | Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing skip-to-content link in `src/app/layout.tsx`. | Keyboard users must tab through the full nav on every page. | Marketing Engineering | Add reusable `SkipLink` component + automated test (`pnpm lint` rule). |
| Color contrast regression on gradient hero text (`src/app/page.tsx`). | Text over gradients drops below 4.5:1 on small screens. | Design | Replace with semi-opaque overlay; verify with axe CI. |
| Dialog aria labeling (`src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`). | Mobile nav uses `Sheet` without explicit `aria-label`. | Marketing Engineering | Follow Shadcn guidance: pass `aria-label` or include `SheetDescription`. |
| Toast announcements. | Current toasts rely on visual styles only. | Product Collab | Implement `role="status"` + live region before public beta. |

Outstanding items are mirrored in the internal accessibility backlog and tracked via `marketing#145` (skip link) and `marketing#148` (gradient contrast).

## Testing Strategy

- **Automated** – Jest + axe assertions live in `app.startupai.site/frontend/src/__tests__/accessibility/wcag-compliance.test.tsx`. Marketing views are imported into that suite so regressions surface in CI (`pnpm test` + `pnpm lint` gate Netlify deploys).
- **Manual** – Quarterly audit following the legacy checklist in `/tmp/pre_migration_marketing/docs/design/user-experience.md` (retained in Git history). Focus on keyboard-only walkthrough, VoiceOver smoke test, colour contrast sampling.

## Internationalization Readiness

| Concern | Current State | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Locale handling** | `<html lang="en">` hard-coded in `src/app/layout.tsx`. No routing-based locales yet. | Introduce locale-aware metadata generator when we add ES/DE. |
| **Copy management** | Content authored directly in TSX modules with structured arrays (e.g., `src/app/product/page.tsx`). | Extract hero copy + value props into JSON schema so translators can work in a spreadsheet/Notion. |
| **CTA routing** | Pricing CTAs link to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` with plan param. Plans use slug-friendly IDs (`trial`, `strategy-sprint`, etc.) that will remain locale-agnostic. | Add translation layer for visible label while keeping query param stable. |
| **Date/time** | Static dates (e.g., timeline in `/process`) currently formatted for en-US. | Replace with `Intl.DateTimeFormat` helper before multi-locale launch. |

Internationalization features will land alongside CMS exploration (see `docs/work/roadmap.md#q2-2026-content-expansion`). Until then English remains the only supported locale.

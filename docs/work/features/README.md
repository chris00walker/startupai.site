# Feature Documentation

Create a folder per feature under `docs/work/features/<feature-slug>/` with two files:

- `feature.md` – Scope, hypothesis, and acceptance criteria.
- `outcomes.md` – Results, metrics, and links to live assets.

Example structure:

```
features/
  pricing-refresh/
    feature.md
    outcomes.md
```

Feel free to copy this template when adding new work.

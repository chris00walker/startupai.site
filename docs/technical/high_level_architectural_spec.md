## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the **high-level architecture** of the StartupAI two-site platform. The system uses a **marketing-to-product architecture** where startupai.site converts prospects to customers, then securely hands them off to app.startupai.site for core value delivery. The platform enables entrepreneurs, founders, and agencies to generate and validate **Evidence-Led Business Strategies** using a CrewAI-powered workflow with Supabase authentication, deployed across two optimized sites.

## 2. Service Tiers

The platform supports three service tiers:  

1. **Strategy Sprint** ‚Äì one-time run of the 6-agent CrewAI workflow.  
2. **Founder Platform** ‚Äì subscription model, multiple runs with historical tracking.  
3. **Agency Co-Pilot** ‚Äì multi-tenant, white-label runs for agencies serving multiple clients.

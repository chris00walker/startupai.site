# MCP Server Configuration

This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced AI assistant capabilities.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
   ```

2. Update `.mcp.json` with your credentials:

### Netlify Configuration
- **NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN**: Get from https://app.netlify.com/user/applications/personal
- **NETLIFY_SITE_ID**: Found in your Netlify site settings or use `netlify status`

### Supabase Configuration
- **project_ref**: Your Supabase project reference (found in project URL)
- **Authorization**: Your Supabase service role key (Project Settings > API)

### Shadcn Configuration
- No credentials needed, uses npx to run the latest version

## Configured MCP Servers

- **netlify**: Netlify deployment and site management
- **supabase**: Database operations and management
- **shadcn**: UI component library integration

## Troubleshooting

If MCP servers disconnect:
1. Verify `.mcp.json` exists and has valid credentials
2. Check that credentials haven't expired
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Run `npx -y @netlify/mcp` to test Netlify connection manually
5. Check Supabase project status at https://supabase.com/dashboard

## Security Notes

- `.mcp.json` is gitignored to protect credentials
- Never commit actual credentials to version control
- Use `.mcp.json.example` as a reference template
- Keep backups of your `.mcp.json` in a secure location (password manager, encrypted storage)
